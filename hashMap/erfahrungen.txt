The results are making sense.
Since we hold it evident that the given hashfunction-family is c-universal.
So the output for p>||U|| and p>m is spread evenly across all buckets.
Therefore the estimated size of each bucket is 1. So is c=0.

When using a small prime number the hash function is no longer c-universal.
Using the random sets it was not possible to generate a completely degenerated table (C=m).
But it was possible to create up to  

For running with p=101 the result is:
mean of c: 0.000000
max of c: 0.000000
min of c: 0.000000

For running with p=10 the result is:
mean of c: 6.184048
max of c: 11.666667
min of c: 5.000000
